The Student Complaint Cell (SCC) Android app categorizes complaints into two types: simple/personal complaints and voting complaints, each with its own handling process. Simple or personal complaints are typically submitted by individual students to address specific issues they face. These complaints are forwarded to the next level of administration if not addressed within a set period. For example, if a complaint remains unresolved by the assigned SSO (Single Sign-On) within three days, it is automatically escalated to the Registrar, and if still unresolved, it moves to the Vice-Chancellor (VC) and then the President. This ensures that personal complaints are addressed promptly and appropriately at higher administrative levels if needed.

On the other hand, voting complaints are submitted for issues that affect a larger group of students, such as widespread concerns or university-wide problems. These complaints involve a voting mechanism where students can vote in support of the issue. Based on the percentage of votes received, the complaint is escalated through the administrative hierarchy. If a complaint reaches a 30% vote threshold, it is forwarded from the SSO to the Registrar; at 60%, it escalates to the VC, and at 90%, it is passed on to the President for resolution. This voting system ensures that issues with broad student support are escalated and prioritized according to their significance. Thus, the app uses these two distinct mechanisms to manage complaints efficiently, addressing personal issues through timely escalation and allowing collective student voices to influence the resolution of larger problems.

The Student Complaint Cell (SCC) Android app also features a survey mechanism to engage students on general or university-related topics. Surveys can cover a variety of themes, such as gathering opinions on preferences or improvements, for instance, asking.
